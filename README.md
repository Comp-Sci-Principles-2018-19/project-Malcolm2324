# Project Name:

## Problem
The big problem is boredem. People do not have enough enterainment. Some kids do not want to watch tv. ALso, they do not have any fun video games to play. Another reson that I also want to fix boredom is to keep kids of the streets and while they are inside their house, they have something to do.

## Big Fat Idea
My big fat idea is to make a series of games that kids would love. These games will have different levels, different objectives and different settings. There would be an update on every game and there will be about 4 to 5 games.

## First Agile Iteration
My first agile Iteration is to make a text based game. This game will include dragons, other monsters and trap doors. This is my first step because I think kids will have fun playing this game.
